# Probability calibration methodologies with local expert ensembles

Presentation for 2017 MORS Symposium, funded by Omar N. Bradley Research Fellowship in Mathematics.

Here are links to the [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4JSUaIvN9OdWlB0UnNPLWtIdHc/view?usp=sharing) of the presentation, as well as to the [source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nnormandin/MORS_2017/master/presentation.Rmd) used to generate it.

This research is completely reproducible, relying on just a few packages. Note that the `localexpeRt` package is not on CRAN, but you can get it pretty easily:

```r
devtools::install_github('nnormandin/localexpeRt')
```
