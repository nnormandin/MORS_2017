## What is `local expert`?

I created a new kind of ensemble forecasting method that I've called local expert regression. It involves the decomposition of a supervised learning task with a continuous target variable (*regression*) into a series of of many $\{0, 1\}$ mappings corresponding to separate *binary probabilistic classification* tasks that produce estimates on the $[0, 1]$ interval.

#####  Why is this useful ?! 
Because you can aggregate the ensemble predictions to form a completely unique *probability distribution function* for each prediction. You can understand **risk** not just in terms of a model, but in terms of each individual forecast.

#### ...see **[github.com/nnormandin/localexpeRt](https://github.com/nnormandin/localexpeRt)**

<!-- ## What problem am I solving? -->

<!-- Most classification methods produce scores for class membership which are interpereted as measures of class affiliation probability. This is the foundation of local expert regression. However, these 'probabilities' are not usually **well-calibrated**.  -->

<!-- #### Definition -->
<!-- For a model $f$ and score $s_i$ to be well-calibrated for class $c_i$, the empirical probability of a correct classification $P(c_i | f( c_i | x_i)=s_i)$ must converge to $f(c_i | x_i) = s_i$. -->

<!-- #### Example -->
<!-- When $s_i = 0.9$, the probability of a correct classification should converge to $P(c_i | s_i = 0.9) = 0.9$. Otherwise, this isn't *really* a 'probability.' -->

## What problem am I solving?

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}

Most classification methods produce scores for class membership which are interpereted as measures of class affiliation probability. This is the foundation of local expert regression. However, these 'probabilities' are not usually \textbf{well-calibrated}. 

\end{column}


\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Definition:}

For a model $f$ and score $s_i$ to be well-calibrated for class $c_i$, the empirical probability of a correct classification $P(c_i | f( c_i | x_i)=s_i)$ must converge to $f(c_i | x_i) = s_i$.

\end{block}
\begin{block}{Example:}

When $s_i = 0.9$, the probability of a correct classification should converge to $P(c_i | s_i = 0.9) = 0.9$. Otherwise, this isn't \textit{really} a 'probability.'

\end{block}
\end{column}
\end{columns}



## How do I propose to solve it?

#### If probabilities aren't properly calibrated, the PDFs interpolated from them won't be reliable. How can we deal with this?

1. Change the loss function
     + $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}-y_i\log(p_i)-(1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)$
2. Calibrate probabilities
     + isotonic regression, sigmoid transforms?

# Local expert

## How is local expert different from normal regression?
Let's say you want to predict the high temperature in West Point, NY, tomorrow and you have a vector of covariates $\mathbf{x}_i$ pertaining to weather forecasting.

# Probability calibration

## Why are some model scores poorly calibrated?

\begin{columns}[t]
\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}

\begin{block}{$s_i$ dense around 0.5}
\begin{itemize}
\item Maximal margin hyperplanes push scores away from extremes of distribution
\item Common in support vector machines, boosted learners
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{column}


\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}

\begin{block}{$s_i$ dense around 0, 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Model assumptions make class probabilites unrealistically confident
\item Naive Bayes!
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}
\end{columns}


## How can we visualize calibration?

##### Reliability plots!
1. Bin predictions by $s_i$ (x-axis)
2. Calculate accuracy by bin (y-axis)

## Method 1: Isotonic Regression
A strictly-nondecreasing piecewise linear function $m$, where $y_i = m(s_i) + \epsilon$ fit such that:

\begin{centering}
$\hat{m} = {argmin}_z \sum_i{y_i-z(s_i) ^2}$
\end{centering}

## Method 2: Platt Scaling
