## What is `local expert`?

I created a new kind of ensemble forecasting method that I've called local expert regression. It involves the decomposition of a supervised learning task with a continuous target variable (*regression*) into a series of of many $\{0, 1\}$ mappings corresponding to separate *binary probabilistic classification* tasks that produce estimates on the $[0, 1]$ interval.

#####  Why is this useful ?! 
Because you can aggregate the ensemble predictions to form a completely unique *probability distribution function* for each prediction. You can understand **risk** not just in terms of a model, but in terms of each individual forecast.

#### ...see **[github.com/nnormandin/localexpeRt](https://github.com/nnormandin/localexpeRt)**

## What problem am I solving?

Most classification methods produce scores for class membership which are interpereted as measures of class affiliation probability. This is the foundation of local expert regression. However, these 'probabilities' are not usually **well-calibrated**. For a model $f$ and score $s_i$ to be well-calibrated for class $c_i$, the empirical probability of a correct classification $P(c_i | f( c_i | x_i)=s_i)$ must converge to $f(c_i | x_i) = s_i$.

For example, when $s_i = 0.9$, the probability of a correct classification should converge to $P(c_i | s_i = 0.9) = 0.9$. Otherwise, this isn't *really* a 'probability.'

## How do I propose to solve it?

#### If probabilities aren't properly calibrated, the PDFs interpolated from them won't be reliable. How can we deal with this?

1. Change the loss function
     + $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}-y_i\log(p_i)-(1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)$
2. Calibrate probabilities
     + isotonic regression, sigmoid transforms?
